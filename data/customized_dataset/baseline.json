      "QUESTION": "What is the main contribution of the 'Attention is All You Need' paper?",
      "ANSWER": "The main contribution is the introduction of the Transformer model, which relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms and does not use recurrent or convolutional layers.",

    },
    "2": {
      "QUESTION": "What is self-attention?",
      "ANSWER": "Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when encoding a particular word.",

    },
    "3": {
      "QUESTION": "How does the Transformer model handle long-range dependencies?",
      "ANSWER": "The Transformer model handles long-range dependencies using self-attention mechanisms, which can directly relate any two words in a sentence regardless of their distance.",

    "4": {
      "QUESTION": "What are the key components of the Transformer model?",
      "ANSWER": "The key components of the Transformer model are the encoder and decoder, each composed of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks.",

    "5": {
      "QUESTION": "What is the role of positional encoding in the Transformer model?",
      "ANSWER": "Positional encoding provides information about the position of words in a sentence, which is crucial since the Transformer model does not use recurrence.",
